# Data

Not in git (see `.gitignore`), except this file. Anyone can rebuild `data/` with the download scripts.

```
data/raw/          downloaded files, never edited; checksums in data/raw/SHA256SUMS
data/processed/    derived tables, named PX-YY_<name>.csv after the task that made them
data/agentic_bundle/  frozen inputs for extension A (raw files + provider docs only)
```

Notes:
- Checksums of every raw file: `data/raw/SHA256SUMS` (tracked in git). Check with `sha256sum -c data/raw/SHA256SUMS`.
- Binance files are the zips exactly as published (monthly up to 2026-09, daily for 1–30 Oct 2026), each
  verified against Binance's `.CHECKSUM`. Each holds one headerless CSV; read with `pd.read_csv(f, header=None)`.
- Binance kline timestamps are milliseconds up to 2024 and **microseconds** from 2025 (switch at the
  2025-01 file in every pair). Binance timestamps are UTC.
- Coinbase file: one row per hourly candle as the API returned it (`time_unix_utc` in seconds, low, high, open,
  close, volume in USDT); hours without trades have no row. Written by our script, so the checksum covers our
  serialisation of the API values.
- PTAX `dataHoraCotacao` is the **publication** time in Brasília time (UTC-3, no daylight saving since 2019),
  not the time of the four averaging windows. One date (2025-04-23) appears twice with identical rates.
- Coverage audit per pair: task P1-01 → Result, and `results/tables/P1-01_coverage.csv`.
